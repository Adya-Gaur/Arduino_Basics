# Stage E: Mini Projects Integration 🤖🧩

## 🧠 Overview
This stage focuses on **combining inputs, outputs, sensors, and motors** to create small functional projects.  
The goal is to apply everything learned in previous stages to make Arduino respond intelligently to its environment, laying the foundation for building complete robots.

## ⚙️ Tools & Components Used
- Arduino Uno  
- LEDs  
- Push buttons  
- LDR, IR, and Ultrasonic sensors  
- DC motors + L293D motor driver  
- Servo motor (optional)  
- Resistors, breadboard, jumper wires  
- Arduino IDE  

## 📚 Concepts & Learnings
- Integrating multiple sensors and actuators in a single system  
- Writing logical conditions combining sensor readings and motor actions  
- Debugging multi-component projects  
- Understanding timing and sequencing in more complex programs  
- Modular code design: creating reusable functions for repeated actions  
- Using Serial Monitor to observe combined system behavior  

## 🧩 Projects in this Stage

2. **Smart_Park_Sensor.ino** – Ultrasonic sensor triggers LED/Buzzer when an object is nearby.   [YouTube Demo](https://youtu.be/ZOEEM-Dtyig)
3. **Button_Controlled_Car.ino** – Buttons control forward, backward, and turning of a motor-driven car.   [YouTube Demo](https://www.youtube.com)
4. **Buzzer_Melody.ino** – Different tunes usig buzzer.   [YouTube Demo](https://youtu.be/Wvv2x7QWDfY)

## 🔍 Observations / Notes
- Learned how inputs from different sensors can be combined to control outputs effectively.  
- Observed the importance of testing each component individually before integration.  
- Gained experience in debugging timing issues and sensor interference.  
- Practiced writing clean, modular code to manage complex projects.  

## 🚀 Next Steps
With this stage completed, I’m ready to move on to my **Final Robot Project: Line Follower + Obstacle Avoider**, where I will combine line sensors, ultrasonic sensors, and dual motor control to build a fully autonomous robot.
