/*An IR sensor works using infrared light reflections. It has two eyes - IR LED (transmitter) and one photodiode (receiver). The transmitter sends out invusuble IR light. If there's
an object or white surface, IR light reflects back -> sensor detects it. If the surface is black or away -> IR light gets absorbed. So:
Object/White - Output LOW(0) ; No Object/Black -> Output HIGH(1)
