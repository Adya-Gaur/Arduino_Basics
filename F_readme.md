# Stage F: Miscellaneous Projects 🔧

## 🧠 Overview
This stage focuses on **exploring additional Arduino functionalities** that complement the core learning path.  
These projects allowed me to experiment with sound, data monitoring, and real-time readings — reinforcing my understanding of Arduino’s versatility beyond basic input/output and motor control.

## ⚙️ Tools & Components Used
- Arduino Uno  
- Buzzer  
- Temperature sensor (LM35 or DHT11)  
- USB cable and Arduino IDE  
- Jumper wires and breadboard  

## 📚 Concepts & Learnings
- Generating sound using a buzzer with the `tone()` function  
- Reading sensor data and displaying it on the **Serial Monitor**  
- Mapping analog readings to meaningful real-world values  
- Combining sensors and outputs in mini standalone experiments  
- Reinforcing modular coding and sequential logic  

## 🧩 Projects in this Stage
1. **Buzzer_Melody.ino** – Create simple tunes using the Arduino buzzer.  
2. **Temperature_Display.ino** – Measure ambient temperature and display it on the Serial Monitor.  
3. **Data_Display_Serial.ino** – Read analog sensor data and print real-time values to the Serial Monitor for observation and analysis.  

## 🔍 Observations / Notes
- Learned that sound output requires careful timing to produce melodies accurately.  
- Realized the Serial Monitor is a powerful tool for debugging and visualizing sensor data.  
- Practiced mapping raw analog values to real-world units for meaningful interpretation.  
- These mini experiments strengthened my understanding of Arduino as a platform for **interactive and responsive projects**.  

## 🚀 Next Steps
Having explored these miscellaneous projects, I am fully prepared to **integrate all skills** — LEDs, inputs, sensors, motors, and logic — into my **final robotics project: Line Follower + Obstacle Avoider**.
